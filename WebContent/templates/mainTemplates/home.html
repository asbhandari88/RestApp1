            <p>Welcome to Great India Cafe
                Since 1989, Combining regional, home-style Indian cuisine with the spontaneous and deep flavors of Indian street food, Great India Cafe has been flourishing ever since an early Studio City Times article exposed this little gem to a curry-craving public. Now Studio City can't get enough of this lighter take on traditional Indian-restaurant cuisine that owner Kamal Jit Singh brings to this quaint but homey little Westside bistro. From tandoori-grilled entr√©es, vindaloos and curries to lamb or chicken "frankies" (Indian-style burritos), specialties are an ideal mix of California taste and authentic Indian flavor. Wash it all down with a specialty cocktail or a choice from the fine selection of imported beers.
